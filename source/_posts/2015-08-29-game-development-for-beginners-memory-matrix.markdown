Disclimer: this is my first attempt to create HTML5 game.

There is quit a lot of game engines to choose from. After a shor research I have ended up selecting Phaser.io which 
seems to be the most popular one (free) it has all features I thouhg I would need to create my first game. 
Hopefully I haven'y missed something importany.
